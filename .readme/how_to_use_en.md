## Description

The **dvpl_go** utility allows you to work with files in the DVPL format. It can be used in two modes:

1. **Full Installation**: After installation, the utility integrates into the operating system's context menu, enabling quick access for selected files or folders (see screenshot below).
2. **Manual Launch**: The converter can be placed in any folder and run directly from there. In this case, two modes are available:
   - Compressing files into the DVPL format.
   - Decompressing files from the DVPL format.

## Installation

### Full Installation
1. Run the installer named `dvpl_go_installer.exe`.
